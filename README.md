# Bioinformatics Practice with Rosalind

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the [Rosalind bioinformatics platform](http://rosalind.info/), which provides algorithmic challenges rooted in molecular biology. I am using these exercises to strengthen my computational and analytical skills while building intuition for the algorithms that underpin modern bioinformatics.

## Why Rosalind?

Rosalind problems bridge the gap between biology and computer science. Each challenge reflects a real bioinformatics concept, such as counting nucleotides, transcribing DNA to RNA, translating RNA to protein, finding motifs, or working with FASTA files. By solving them, I am practicing both programming (Python/R) and the biological logic behind sequence analysis.

## Repository Structure

* **DNA/** – Basic DNA sequence operations (counting nucleotides, GC content, reverse complements).
* **RNA/** – Transcription and translation tasks.
* **Proteins/** – Peptide encoding, motif finding, mass spectrometry problems.
* **Combinatorics/** – Population genetics, Mendelian inheritance, probability models.
* **Applied/** – Extensions of Rosalind problems applied to real biological datasets (e.g., NCBI FASTA files, sample RNA-seq reads).

## Tools & Languages

* **Python** (main language, using Biopython where helpful).
* **R** (for statistical tasks and visualization).
* **Matplotlib/ggplot2** (to plot sequence statistics and enrichment results).

## Learning Goals

* Develop confidence in writing clear, reproducible code for biological problems.
* Connect fundamental sequence algorithms to real-world genomics and transcriptomics workflows.
* Build a foundation for analyzing larger datasets in my MSc research (e.g., GWAS, RNA-seq).
